#### Description:

This was a 1 week long project. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

### Tecnologies applied:

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to check the status of patients data from the .net backend build for me. I started this process by using the `create-react-app rx-front --template typescrit` boilerplate, then adding libraries how:

[typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) to view it in the browser.

[react-router](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router) to view it in the browser.

[redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux) to view it in the browser.

[formik](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik) to view it in the browser.

[yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) to view it in the browser.
